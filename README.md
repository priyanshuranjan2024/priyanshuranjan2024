# 👋 Welcome to Priyanshu Ranjan's GitHub

Hey! I'm Priyanshu Ranjan — an upcoming third-year Computer Science student. This space is a mix of everything I’ve been building, breaking, fixing, and learning. From backend systems to deep learning models, it’s all part of the journey.

## 🛠️ About Me

- Full-stack and backend developer — I work with Node.js, Laravel, Spring Boot, React, and MongoDB/PostgreSQL. Built and led teams for scalable backend migrations.
- deep learning — working on breast cancer subtype classification with real-world genomic and imaging datasets under Dr. Nikhilanand Arya.
- Regular LeetCoder — solving DSA problems regularly to stay sharp.
- Curious about everything from systems, software security, machine learning, to how things scale in the real world.
